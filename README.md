# gpt3-persona-bot
a simple bot that allows you to chat with various personas

You will need a key. 

## Lot's of TODOs here. 

* Better handling when there isn't a good response.
* Better handling of repeating responses
* Break the prompts into JSON Q/A pairs and then merge in prompt building
  * Allows for some meta data and source data in persona generation
  * Can have "names" 
* Maybe some easier hooks into various chat apps
* More personas
  * Doctor?
  * Dungeon master
  * More politicians?
  * Plato? lol
